#Java 2D Physics Engine

A simple 2D java physics engine, adapted to support some basic game mechanics (character movement,
terrain modification, etc...).  Doesn't support rotation, and the collision detection algorithm is
fairly naive.

###How to Run

Just run GameFrame.java (in src/main) in the standard way, aka...

`java GameFrame.java`
